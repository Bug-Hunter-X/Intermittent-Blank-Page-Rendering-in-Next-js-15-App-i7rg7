# Next.js 15 Intermittent Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js 15 application where the initial page renders blank intermittently. The issue is not consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging.  This repo includes both the problematic code and a potential solution.

## Problem

The `pages/index.js` file contains a simple component. However, under certain (unspecified) conditions, the application fails to render this component, resulting in a blank page.  No errors are typically reported in the browser's console.

## Solution

The solution involves [insert solution strategy/explanation here - e.g., ensuring proper async/await usage, checking for conflicting dependencies etc.]. The `pages/index.solution.js` file demonstrates a possible fix.
